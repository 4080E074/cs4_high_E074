```
On-demand self-service隨需自助服務. A consumer can unilaterally(單方面) provision(提供) computing capabilities(能力), such as
server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring(需要) human
interaction with each service provider.

Broad network access隨時隨地用任何網路裝置存取. Capabilities are available over the network(通過網路提供) and accessed through standard
mechanisms that promote use by that promote use(促進使用) by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g.,
mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).

Resource pooling多人共享資源池. The provider’s computing resources(資源) are pooled to serve multiple(服務多個) consumers
using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically
assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location
independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact
location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of
abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage,
processing, memory, and network bandwidth.
提供者的計算資源被集合起來為多個消費者服務
使用多租戶模型，動態使用不同的物理和虛擬資源
根據客戶需求進行分配和重新分配。有位置感
獨立性，因為客戶通常無法控制或瞭解
所提供資源的位置，但可以指定更高級別的位置
抽象（例如，國家、州或資料中心）。資源的例子包括存儲，
處理、記憶體和網路頻寬。

Rapid elasticity快速重新部署靈活度. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases
automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the
consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can
be appropriated in any quantity at any time.

Measured service被監控與量測的服務. Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging
a metering capability1 at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g.,
storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be
monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and
consumer of the utilized service.

### Deployment Models:
```
Private cloud私有雲. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned(設定) for exclusive use(獨佔使用) by a single organization(單個組織)
comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units企業單位). It may be owned, managed, and
operated by the organization它可能被擁有、管理和由組織、協力廠商或它們的某些組合操作, a third party, or some combination of them,
and it may exist on or off premises.
私有雲具備許多公用雲環境的優點，例如彈性、適合提供服務，兩者差別在於私有雲服務中，資料與程式皆在組織內管理，且與公用雲服務不同，不會受到網路頻寬、安全疑慮、法規限制影響；此外，私有雲服務讓供應者及使用者更能掌控雲端基礎架構、改善安全與彈性，因為使用者與網路都受到特殊限制

Community cloud社群雲. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific
community(特定社區) of consumers(消費者) from organizations(組織) that have shared concerns (e.g., mission,
security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations任務，組織安全要求，政策和合規考慮). It may be owned,
managed, and operated(管理和運營) by one or more of the organizations(一個或多個組織) in the community, a third
party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.
社群雲由眾多利益相仿的組織掌控及使用，例如特定安全要求、共同宗旨等。社群成員共同使用雲端資料及應用程式。

Public cloud公有雲. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be
owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization(商業、學術或政府組織), or
some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.
公用雲服務可透過網路及第三方服務供應者，開放給客戶使用，「公用」一詞並不一定代表「免費」，但也可能代表免費或相當廉價，公用雲並不表示使用者資料可供任何人檢視，公用雲供應者通常會對使用者實施使用存取控制機制，公用雲作為解決方案，既有彈性，又具備成本效益。

Hybrid cloud混合雲. The cloud infrastructure is a composition(組成) of two or more distinct cloud
infrastructures (private, community, or public私有，社區或公共) that remain unique entities(唯一的實體), but are bound
together by standardized or proprietary technology(標準化或專有技術) that enables data and application
portability(可攜性) (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds雲之間負載平衡的雲爆發). 
混合雲結合公用雲及私有雲，這個模式中，使用者通常將非企業關鍵資訊外包，並在公用雲上處理，但同時掌控企業關鍵服務及資料。

### Service Models

[1]Software as a Service軟體即服務 (SaaS)
```

```
```
. The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider’s
applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from
various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g.,
web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the
underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or
even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited userspecific application configuration settings.

[2]Platform as a Service (PaaS)

```
```
. The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud
infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services,
and tools supported by the provider.3 The consumer does
not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers,
operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly
configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.

[3]Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
```

```

```
The capability provided to the consumer is to provision
processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the
consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating
systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud
infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications;
and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).
